# Shopping Cart Project

This project is a shopping cart application built from scratch using React. It started 2 years ago as my first React project with the goal of creating a basic Material-UI (MUI) React website for a bar. The initial aim was to gain experience in React, but as I started experimenting, one of the most challenging implementations was a shopping cart from scratch. Consequently, this project quickly evolved into the shopping cart project it is today.

## Features

- Add and remove items from the cart
- View cart summary and total price
- Experimentation with MUI components
- Filter Products

## Technologies Used

- React
- Material-UI (MUI)
- Node.js

## Project Highlights

- **First React Project**: This project marks my entry into the world of React, showcasing my ability to learn and implement new technologies.
- **UI/UX Design**: Leveraged Material-UI to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
- **Challenges**: One of the most difficult implementations was creating a shopping cart from scratch.

## Acknowledgements

This project has been a significant learning experience, providing me with hands-on experience in React and Material-UI. Unfortunately, it never reached a point where I was happy enough to implement a backend. Due to my education, I was cut short on time and had to focus on other things.
